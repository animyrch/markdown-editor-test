# markdown-editor-test

## Notes

* Mockup shows colors within the editor's textarea for custom tags. This could be achieved easily with a div by setting contenteditable=true but we would lose the natural feel and functionalities of a native textarea. Another way of achieving this would be to use a WYSIWYG editor plugin but this would defeat the purpose of this exercice since we are creating our own editor-renderer. Therefore, I opted not to use colors for custom tags.
